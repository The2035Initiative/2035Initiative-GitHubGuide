For example, that might return something like this (or it could differ a bit): /usr/local/bin/git. If you instead get no response at all, you should download & install git from here: git-scm.com/downloads\r\nIn RStudio, open the Terminal. Run the following commands (by pressing Enter after each line), replacing the username (keep the quotation marks!) and email with your username and email used for your GitHub account.\r\ngit config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\" git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com\r\nThen, in the Terminal run the following, carefully checking that the name and email returned match your GitHub information:\r\ngit config --list --global\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If you are not a member yet, please send Sofia Ingersoll or Emma Franzblau an email to be added.\r\nTransferring Your Repository into Organization\r\nWe request that you kindly transfer any 2035 Initiative related GitHub projects into our Organization, to optimize our project management and communication. You can transfer any repository you’ve uploaded to the organization using the following steps:\r\nOn GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.\r\nUnder your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the “Settings” tab, select the dropdown menu, then click Settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the page, in the “Danger Zone” section, click Transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the information about transferring a repository, then, under “New owner”, select our organization from the drop down menu.\r\nRead the warnings about potential loss of features depending on the new owner’s GitHub subscription.\r\nFollowing Type REPOSITORY NAME to confirm, type the name of the repository you’d like to transfer, then click I understand, transfer this repository.\r\nIf you published a GitHub Pages site in a private repository and added a custom domain, before transferring the repository, you may want to remove or update your DNS records to avoid the risk of a domain takeover. For more information, see “Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.”\r\nAdding Repository Collaborators\r\nOftentimes you’ll find yourself collaborating with a person, or even a team of people on a project. To optimize the project’s workflow, it would be most beneficial to add everyone to the project repository as collaborators.\r\n** Image of adding collaborators example **\r\nBranches\r\nTo optimize collaboration and avoid the risk of merge conflicts, branches are the best tool in your box.\r\nUsing the Terminal to make a branch:\r\nUsing GitHub to make a branch:\r\n** When working with others on a project, always git pull before you start a new working session **\r\nMerge Request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here, only using Google fonts is described (there are other methods for downloading fonts and adding, not included here).\r\nFonts are imported and specified in theme.css\r\nIn your Project in RStudio, open the theme.css file.\r\nNear the top, you’ll see some lines that look like this:\r\n/* Header font */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sanchez&display=swap');\r\n\r\n/* Body font */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito+Sans:wght@300;400&display=swap');\r\n\r\n/* Code font (Roboto Mono) */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300;400&display=swap');\r\nThose are the import command to get 3 different Google fonts (Sanchez, Nunito Sans, and Roboto Mono). You can explore many different Google fonts here.\r\nUse different fonts\r\nFind a Google Font you like.\r\nClick on the font. To the right of the font example text, you should see an option to ‘+ Select this style’. Click the one(s) you want to select.\r\nThat will probably bring up a side menu. If you don’t see that side menu, you can see your selected styles at any time by clicking on the top-right menu icon that is a grid with 3 squares and a plus sign - hovering reveals this is to ‘View your selected families’. In the Use on the web section of the side menu that appears, select the radio button for @import. It’ll look weird like this (for the Zen Dots Google Font):\r\n    <style>\r\n    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Zen+Dots&display=swap');\r\n    <\/style> \r\nCopy everything BETWEEN (but excluding) the ending <style> and <\/style>tags\r\nPaste the @import line you’ve copied into the top section of theme.css near the other fonts imported there. It is now available for use in your theme.\r\nUpdate the css with your new fonts, replacing the existing font names with the name you’ve imported. You might want to use a Find & Replace All if you want to make sure you’re updating a font everywhere it appears in the current theme.\r\nRepeat for as many different fonts as you want to update in your theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
