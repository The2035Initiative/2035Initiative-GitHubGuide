## Project Structure SOP

Below are the standard operating procedures for organizing your project repository structure. These guidelines will optimize your workflow and allow for greater reproducibility of your open sourced code.

### README

Open sourced coding projects need a descriptive `README` for their
respective repository. The `README` can contain images related to the projected, such as The 2035 Initiative logo, the project deliverable, or topical images related to the subject.

It needs to contain a brief overview on the project, its objective, as well as, some background on the data utilized. In-text citations are highly recommended, GitHub does a very nice job combining these
citations into a footnote.

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "README footnote example."}

#knitr::include_graphics("img/README.jpeg")

```

## Data Management

### Naming Conventions

Projects, folders, data, and documents should be labeled clearly and intuitively. Abbreviations utilized throughout your project belong in a detailed data sheet. The same goes for objects within our code, but further discussion on this can be found in Topic 5: Reproducible Workflows.

### Organizing Files

Folders are a quick way to keep your projects organized categorize
documents. When organizing your project it's helpful to imagine your files in a tree-like structure:

```
Project_Name 
│ README.md 
│ Rmd/Project files 
| .gitignore 
│
└───data 
  | | sample_data.shp 
  | | sample_data.gpkg 
  |
  └───sample_data.gdb 
  | | sample data gdb files 
  │
  └───sample_subset_folder 
  │ | sub-data_2008.tif
  │ | sub-data_2009.tif 
  │ | sub-data_2010.tif 
  │ | sub-data_2011.tif
```

#### Using .gitignore.

For sensitive documents or data files that are too large (100 MiB or greater) to be pushed to GitHub, they can be hidden using the `.gitignore` file. Within the `.gitignore` file, you can specify documents to be excluded from your commit to GitHub. It is recommended to upload large files into a Google Drive and provide public access via a link in your README.
    
  - A general note: GitHub limits the size of your repository and
  strongly recommends they remain less than 1 GB and no greater
  than 5 GB. 

### Managing Repository Size

To monitor your repository size and prevent/mitigate any potential
issues that may arise regarding over-sized files, refer to the
[github/git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) repository. 

This resource provides insight on how to use `git-sizer` to assess the size of files within your local repository before committing them.
