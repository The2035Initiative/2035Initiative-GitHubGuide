### Quick Tips
- We want our work to be reproducible so commenting frequently throughout our code in an easy to read, organized manner.

- Avoid writing file paths specific to your local device

- Simplify your workflow wherever possible. In circumstances of task repetition, write a function to streamline your project! 

- Quarto markdown files are a wonderful tool for quick commenting or including detailed information between code chunks. Rmd files are also very easily converted into html files for web applications, using the `Knit` function.

- Including a detailed datasheet 

### Tidy Data & Clean Code

When it comes to cleaning raw data, it's best to follow the tidy data format ("long" format). The [Tidy Data Guide](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham provides insight on how to neatly organize data sets in tidy data format. Three key concepts are outlined in their figure below.

**Note: It's important to always keep a copy of your raw, unprocessed data**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "[Tidy Data Guide](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham"} 

knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-1.png")
```
- Every variable corresponds to its own clearly labeled column, containing units when applicable.
- Every observation corresponds to its own row.
- Every value is contained in its own cell.

#### R & Python Resources

Datasheets for data sets | txt files labeled as `_readme_datafilename`

#### Establishing an Environment

- Libraries

- Package dependencies

In the world of open sourced coding, packages are constantly being updated and new versions are being released. This can lead to some difficulties when
